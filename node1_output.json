  "reasoning_path": "The visible structure shows a grid pattern with a base of 4x4 and a height of 3 layers. The missing cubes are internal, creating voids. The complete structure would be a 4x4x3 cuboid, totaling 48 cubes. The perspective and occlusion were accounted for by observing the visible edges and grid alignment."
