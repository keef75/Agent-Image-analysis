  "confidence": 0.86,
  "reasoning_path": "1) Dimension cues: Both visible side faces show clear unit grids. The right face has three interior vertical grid lines, dividing it into 4 columns horizontally and 4 rows vertically; the left face shows the same 4-by-4 segmentation along depth and height. The front vertical edge stacks 4 unit cubes. These consistent counts across orthogonal directions imply an underlying 4\u00d74\u00d74 lattice. 2) Perspective handling: Although edges are foreshortened, isometric grid lines remain evenly spaced within each face, so counting subdivisions (not lengths) gives reliable unit counts. 3) Occlusion handling: Missing cubes create stepped recesses but do not obscure the outermost grid counts along the left and right faces; thus the base dimensions can be read from the intact outer edges. 4) Total cubes: For a complete structure with these base dimensions, X\u00d7Y\u00d7Z = 4\u00d74\u00d74 = 64. 5) Structural description: The present object is a nearly full 4\u00d74\u00d74 cube with a diagonal/staircase removal across the upper interior, producing multiple exposed step tops (hatched) rather than sealed internal cavities."
